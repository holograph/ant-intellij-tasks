#summary Project to-do list

Before initial release:

  * JavaDocs for all present code
  * Missing tests
  * Run on major codebase (e.g. Delver) to test real-world behavior (done on simple codebase)

Next version:

  * Significant optimizations, possibly:
    * A cache layer for parsed module/project files. Assuming a simple process life cycle for Ant, this will significantly improve packaging and project-wide build times.
    * Dependency checks to see if targets need to be recompiled.
    * Better build artifact reuse, e.g. exploit already-built class files for packaging.

Long-term:

  * Obtain samples of non-Java projects and add support

I. Overview

 ant-intellij-tasks is a self-contained build system for IntelliJ IDEA
 projects based around Apache Ant. In essence, ant-intellij-tasks
 comprises three components:

    1. An Ant task library that can extract and resolve the IntelliJ
       IDEA project and module files (.ipr and .iml respectively),
       and provides a set of tasks and conditions around the project
       structure;
    2. A common build script which provides the four major build
       targets for modules: clean, build, test and package (see section
       III);
    3. A master build script which extends these targets to the entire
       project.

 The build system is designed to be extensible (e.g. by adding targets),
 customizable (e.g. by overriding a target's behavior for a specific
 module) and self contained in that it's a drop-in solution that should
 not require any significant modifications to the code base.

  ant-intellij-tasks makes use of, and redistributes, the ant-contrib task
 library found in: http://ant-contrib.sourceforge.net/

III. Quickstart Guide

 To use ant-intellij-tasks you need to extract the archive to your project
 directory. Specifically, the following four files are required:

    ant-intellij-tasks.jar
    ant-contrib.jar
    common.xml
    build-all.xml

 You can invoke the build directly by specifying the build-all.xml script
 (e.g. ant -f build-all.xml), or you can import build-all.xml to roll out
 your own build script:

    <?xml version="1.0" ?>
    <project default="build">
        <import file="resources/build-all.xml" />
    </project>

 The build targets provided are:

	1. "clean" target: cleans up the build output for all modules.
	2. "build" target: builds the project.
	3. "test" target: Builds and tests the project. Tests are run for
	   files matching one of the following patterns:

		Test?*.java
		?*Test.java
		?*Tests.java

	   Where ? resolves to a single character and * resolves to zero or
	   more characters. Tests may be further customized; please refer to
	   the documentation for the "test-module" macro in common.xml for
	   details.
	4. "package" target: Builds and packages all modules in the project.
	   The exact output is determined by the module and project settings
	   in IntelliJ IDEA:

		- If the project specifies "Build JARs on make" and JAR settings are
		  specified for the module, a JAR is created;
		- If the module has a Web facet with WAR or exploded output enabled,
		  a web module (including web descriptor and output settings as defined
		  in IntelliJ IDEA) is created accordingly.

 Each module may specify its own build.xml, which will override the default
 behavior for these targets. The script will be invoked using the same target,
 with the "profile-file" property pointing at the project file used. Please
 refer to the documentation in common.xml for details on how to customize your
 builds further.
